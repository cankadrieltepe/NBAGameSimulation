Hello!
To see the login system where you can set and change your password run to main in the "User" folder.
To see the actual simulation run the main in the "Player" folder. You can choose 10 players for your own team and the computer chooses 10 players
for its own teams (making sure it has players from all positions) and see them race to win!
The simulation takes around a minute to run. You can pause and resume and see a chart at the end for the play-offs.
You can see all of the results documented in the text files.
ENJOY!
